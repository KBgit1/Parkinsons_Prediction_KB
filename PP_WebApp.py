    ### Overview
    Parkinson's Disease is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. 
    It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. 
    But while tremors are the most well-known sign of Parkinson's disease, the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.

    ### Common Symptoms:
    - Tremor, often in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head
    - Bradykinesia (slowness of movement)
    - Muscle rigidity
    - Postural instability and balance issues
    - Speech and writing changes

    ### Causes:
    Parkinson's Disease is caused by the degeneration of neurons in a specific area of the brain called the *substantia nigra*, 
    which leads to a drop in dopamine levels.

    ### Diagnosis:
    Parkinson's is typically diagnosed based on medical history, symptoms, and neurological and physical exams. 
    Machine learning models trained on voice and movement data can assist in early prediction and monitoring.

    > This web application utilizes a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's Disease based on key vocal measurements.

    ### How to Use This App:
    1. Navigate to the **Diagnosis** tab.
    2. Fill in the numeric values for the 22 voice-related parameters.
    3. Click **Test Result** to see if the person is predicted to have Parkinson's Disease.

    ### Where to Get Parameters:
    These values are usually derived from vocal recordings using specialized audio analysis tools.
    If you're not a clinician or don't have these tools, please consult a medical professional for accurate testing.

    ### Data Source:
    The model used here is trained on the **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons).

    ### About the Model:
    This prediction system uses a trained **Machine Learning model** (like Random Forest, SVM, or Logistic Regression) 
    that has learned patterns from real-world patient data. The results are **indicative only**, and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
